So I hear these things called "blogs" are the next big thing and being the early adopter I am I figure I better have one.

h4. Choosing a Platform

All I need is a basic site where I can put a little information about myself and write an article once in awhile.  I'm a developer so I must be able to hack on it.

Introducing "Webby":http://webby.rubyforge.org/

<% uv :lang => "shell-unix-generic", :line_numbers => false, :theme => "active4d" do -%>
sudo gem install webby
<% end -%>

h4. I'm a Developer, I need to write about Source Code

h5. Introducing Ultraviolet:"http://ultraviolet.rubyforge.org"


h4. What About Comments?

The answer is "Disqus":http://disqus.com.  Adding comments is as easy as copy and pasting a little html from Disqus's site.

<% uv :lang => "html", :line_numbers => false, :theme => "active4d" do -%>
<div id="disqus_thread"></div>
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://disqus.com/forums/username/embed.js"></script>
<noscript><a href="http://username.disqus.com/?url=ref">View the discussion thread.</a></noscript>
<% end -%>
