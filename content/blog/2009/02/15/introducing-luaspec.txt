I've been doing a lot of work with "Lua":http://www.lua.org/ over the past couple of years.  Originally I used "luaunit":http://phil.freehackers.org/programs/luaunit/index.html for unit testing.  This has worked ok, but I've used "RSpec":http://rspec.info/ while working with Ruby and have come to appreciate the specification syle syntax and the different mindset it invokes while writing tests.  So I introduce to you "luaspec":http://github.com/mirven/luaspec/tree/master.

<% uv(:lang => "lua", :line_numbers => true, :theme => "active4d") do -%>
describe["Account, withdrawing funds"] = function()
    before = function()
        account = Account:new { balance = 100 }
        account:withdraw(10)
    end
    
    it["should remove the withdrawl amount from the balance"] = function()
        expect(account.balance).should_be(90)
    end
end
<% end -%>
