h3. About Me

<p class="vcard">My name is <span class="fn n">Marcus Irven</span>. I'm a software developer living in <span class="adr"><span class="locality">Austin</span>, <span class="region">Texas</span></span>.</p>

I'm passionate about software design and development.  I'm not religious about languages (though I do have my preferences), I believe in using the right tool for the job.  I'm comfortable with Ruby, Lua, C/C++, Java, Groovy, and Javascript and have recently began experimenting with Erlang, Scala, Clojure, and Objective-C.

I am the co-founder of "Minggl":http://www.minggl.com and "Reservation Genie":http://www.reservationgenie.com.  

I'm the author of "luaspec":http://github.com/mirven/luaspec, a "behavior-driven design":http://behavior-driven.org framework for the "Lua":http://lua.org  programming langauge.
